I created this blog thanks to this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

Be careful with the Mac OS version of ruby, it doesn't seem to work properly. Instead install the homebrew version: `brew install ruby` and setup thanks to this [link](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/13.html).

An interesting command I discovered to edit a file from the Finder command line: `open -e ~/.zshrc`. Default editor of Mac OS.

And I just commit my pages on the github repo, cool! :)

Ho and as a first starting point for markdown, check [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
